# Heimvik.me personal website
This is the repo for my personal website available at [heimvik.me](https://heimvik.me/). This is a website I made in order to  introduce myself, use as a showcase, and act as a creative outlet/web-dev practice. You are welcome to look through the source code and reuse any of it. Updates to this project may be sporadic or totally non-existent. The project is made using [React](https://reactjs.org/).


If you for some reason want to clone and run the project locally, you can do so by running the following in the project directory:

### `npm start`

Which opens the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in dev mode.
