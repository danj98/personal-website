# Heimvik.me personal website
This is the repo for my personal website available at [heimvik.me](https://heimvik.me/). This is a website I made in order to  introduce myself, use as a showcase, and act as a creative outlet/web-dev practice. The website itself is inspired by the 90's/Y2K style websites that I remember from my childhood. I also wanted to make each page different in order to experiment with different styles.

You are welcome to look through the source code and reuse any of it. Updates to this project may be sporadic or totally non-existent. The project is made using [React](https://reactjs.org/).


If you for some reason want to clone and run the project locally, you can do so by running `npm start` in the project directory. This opens the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in dev mode.
